Install Conda from https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

Create new Conda environment and install required libraries from requirements.txt (not limited to this version, any Python3 will work):
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. conda create --name copilot4prs python=3.8.16
3. conda activate copilot4prs
4. pip install -r requirements.txt

Once all libraries are installed, a user can verify the correctness of installation by:

Follow these steps to execute the code:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook using the command `jupyter notebook`.
3. Obtain GitHub access tokens (https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) and put the token in `./scripts/env/tokens.txt`.
4. Due https://gist.github.com/idan/325676d192b32f169b032fde2d866c2c#github-next--technical-preview-sunsets, now copilot4prs has became `ghost`. Therefore, replace `'copilot4prs'` to `'ghost'` in `CollectCopilot4prs.ipynb`
5. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, run `{script_name}.ipynb` in the order of `CollectCopilot4prs.ipynb`, `ParseHistory.ipynb`, and `BuildingResults.ipynb`.


To run R scripts, install required package from requirements_for_R_scripts.txt.
1. Install R 4.3.1 from CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. cd scripts
4. Rscript `{script_name}.R`
